AquaPi
======

The aim of this project is to utilize the Raspberry Pi as
a platform for an aquarium controller suitable for large
reef and aquaponic systems.

This project is still in the planning phase, as I am currently
developing requirements and sourcing parts.

The project's home page is located at http://aquapi.org

Bug tracking is located at https://code.google.com/p/aquapi/issues/list

Loosely based upon rob's project at thereefuge.com.au

Goals
  * Monitor temperature, pH, ORP, and salinity
  * Control water levels

Ideas
  * Setup script for easy deployment
