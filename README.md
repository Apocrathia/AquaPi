AquaPi
======

The aim of this project is to utilize the Raspberry Pi as
a platform for an aquarium controller suitable for large
reef and aquaponic systems.

This project is still in the planning phase, as I am currently
developing requirements and sourcing parts.

The project's home page is located at [aquapi.org][aquapi.org]

Bug tracking is on[Google Code][googleissues].

Loosely based upon rob's project at [thereefuge.com.au][reefuge]

Goals
  * Monitor temperature, pH, ORP, and salinity
  * Control water levels
  * Dosing control
  * Lighting control
  * Feeder control
  * Air intake control

Ideas
  * Setup script for easy deployment
  * Use jQuery graphs instead of RRD

AquaPi utilizes the following projects
