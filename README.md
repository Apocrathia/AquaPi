AquaPi
======

The aim of this project is to utilize the Raspberry Pi as
a platform for an aquarium controller suitable for large
reef and aquaponic systems.

This project is still in the planning phase, as I am currently
developing requirements and sourcing parts.

Loosely based upon rob's project at thereefuge.com.au
