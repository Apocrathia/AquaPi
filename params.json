{"name":"Aquapi","tagline":"An Arduino + Raspberry Pi Aquarium Controller","body":"# AquaPi\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to utilize the Raspberry Pi as a platform for an aquarium controller suitable for large reef and aquaponic systems.\r\n\r\nThis project is still in an embryonic state, and needs help, as I'm not a great developer.\r\n\r\nThe project's home page is located at [aquapi.org][aquapi.org].\r\n\r\nBug tracking is on [Google Code][googleissues].\r\n\r\nLoosely based upon rob's project at [thereefuge.com.au][reefuge]. Unlike rob's project, which relied heavily upon the Raspberry Pi's digial-only GPIO, this project aims to take advantage of the Arduino's analog/digital capabilities, and interface directly with a Python-based backend. The GPIO can then be used later for an external LCD display.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n  * Monitor temperature, pH, ORP, and salinity\r\n  * Control water levels\r\n  * Dosing control\r\n  * Lighting control\r\n  * Feeder control\r\n  * Air pump control\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n  * Python 2.5 or higher\r\n  * An Arduino compatible microcontroller with at least 14KB of flash memory\r\n  * Flask 0.10\r\n  * arduino-python 0.2\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\n  * **AquaPi is nowhere near ready**\r\n  * Run the following to execute the setup script (as root or with sudo): \r\n```\r\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/Apocrathia/AquaPi/master/tools/setup.sh)\r\n```\t\r\n  * Upload the sketch `avr/src/sketch.ino` to your controller (The script doesn't do this [yet]).\r\n\r\n## AquaPi utilizes the following projects\r\n  * [Flask][flask]\r\n  * [jQuery][jquery]\r\n  * [Inotool][inotool]\r\n  * [pySerial][pyserial]\r\n  * [arduino-python][arduinoapi]\r\n  * And some borrowed code from [SickBeard][sickbeard]\r\n\r\n[aquapi.org]: http://aquapi.org\r\n[reefuge]: http://www.thereefuge.com.au/threads/raspberry-pi-tank-monitor-project.3475\r\n[sickbeard]: http://sickbeard.com\r\n[flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/\r\n[inotool]: http://inotool.org\r\n[jquery]: http://jquery.com\r\n[pyserial]: http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/\r\n[arduinoapi]: https://github.com/thearn/Python-Arduino-Command-API\r\n[buildarduino]: http://playground.arduino.cc/BuildArduino/Py\r\n[googleissues]: http://code.google.com/p/aquapi/issues/list\r\n[googlenewissue]: http://code.google.com/p/aquapi/issues/entry\r\n","google":"UA-46820405-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
